Jexl 2.0 uses Maven 2 as the build tool, and requires Java 1.5 (or later).

The following goals may be useful:
* mvn clean - clean up
* mvn test - compile and run the unit tests
* mvn site - create the documentation
* mvn package - build the jar
* mvn install - build the jar and install in local maven repository

N.B. When building under Java 1.5, you will need to provide access to an implementation
of JSR-223 (javax.script), for example BSF 3.0.
