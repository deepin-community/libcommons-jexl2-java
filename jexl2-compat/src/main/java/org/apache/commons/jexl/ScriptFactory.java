/**
 * <p>
 * Creates {@link Script}s.  To create a JEXL Script, pass
 * valid JEXL syntax to the static createScript() method:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * String jexl = "y = x * 12 + 44; y = y * 4;";
 * Script script = ScriptFactory.createScript( jexl );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When an {@link Script} is created, the JEXL syntax is
 * parsed and verified.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a convenience class; using an instance of a {@link JexlEngine}
 * that serves the same purpose with more control is recommended.
 * </p>
 * @since 1.1
 * @version $Id$
 * @deprecated Create a JexlEngine and use the createScript method on that instead.
