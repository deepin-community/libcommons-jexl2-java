/**
 * Creates Expression objects. 
 * <p>
 * To create a JEXL Expression object, pass
 * valid JEXL syntax to the static createExpression() method:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * String jexl = "array[1]";
 * Expression expression = ExpressionFactory.createExpression( jexl );
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * When an {@link Expression} object is created, the JEXL syntax is
 * parsed and verified.  If the supplied expression is neither an
 * expression nor a reference, an exception is thrown from createException().
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This is a convenience class; using an instance of a {@link JexlEngine}
 * that serves the same purpose with more control is recommended.
 * </p>
 * @since 1.0
 * 
 * @version $Id$
 * @deprecated Create a JexlEngine and use the createScript method on that instead.
