        <h2>Jexl-1.x compatible implementation.</h2>
        <p>
            This package only contains classes that re-implement Jexl-1.x interfaces
            and behaviors. This is intended to allow easier conversion to Jexl-2.0.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jexl-2.0 changed a lot of APIs and behaviors, enough to warrant putting it
            in its own org.apache.commons.jexl2 package and avoid possible "jar-hell" cases.
            Those could have occured if someone was trying to use both Jexl-2.0 and Jexl-1.x.
        </p>
        <p>
            This package contains the original Jexl-1.x main API namely ScriptFactory, ExpressionFactory,
            Script, Expression, JexlContext and JexlHelper. It is not 100% compatible with
            the original Jexl-1.x codeline but should be close enough for "casual" usage.
